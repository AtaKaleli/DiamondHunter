Purpose:

The main purpose of this programming assignment is to revise the topics that we have covered 
so far including arrays, pointers, functions, repetitive statements, conditional statements and 
fundamentals of C programming. In this assignment, you are going to implement a simple oneplayer game based on the given specifications below. The main goal of this game is to hunt the 
diamonds that are hidden in a board.

In your implementation you will keep the coordinates of the diamonds inside a two dimensional 
array. This will help you to practice with arrays, pointers and all of the three control constructs 
(sequence, selection and repetition)

Once the game is started as shown in the above example, then the user can play on this 
UserBoard at most 10 rounds. If the user decides to play the game again, then the program will 
show the user the highest points accumlated so far and user can play again. Hence, the player 
can play as many games as they like but one game can consists of at most 10 rounds.

The game will be played as follows. The user will try to find as many diamonds as possible. In order 
to find a diamond, the user will specify the guessed location in the UserBoard by the following 
format: (row, column).
